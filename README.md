# React_State

In this assignment, I created a marketplace that allows users to view products from Best Buy. The user will be able to view details about the product, and if they decide, add the product to a shopping cart.  

## Code Snippets

![OMG](./pics/components.jpg)

I styled it and wondered why is none of it was working. I kept looking at my components and the apps.js file for any errors. I looked at several classroom exercises that are similar, but the was no misspellings, import component problems. I searched through all the files that are related and couldn't find a thing.

Then suddenly, I thought, isn't there suppose to be a link to bootstrap for styling? I remember in a few exercises is not to forget to add it in the index.html. I opened the index.html file, low and behold, there was no bootstrap stylesheet link. 

## Getting Started

To get started using the application, use any web browser to view live link, (https://pacific-cove-31239.herokuapp.com/). Repository link, (https://github.com/itsmedexter/unit19_State). If you download the repository, you can use gitbash to run mongod first, by typing in the command line "mongod". Then cd into server and do a "node server" to start server. Then cd into client and do a "npm start". This will automaticly open a browser window and have the application running.
